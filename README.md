# Automated Notifications for Housing Project Hearings

# Problem Statement:

Efficiently notifying supporters about public hearings related to housing development projects is currently a manual and time-consuming process.
Advocacy groups must monitor public agendas, watch livestreamed hearings, and identify relevant discussions, such as those surrounding specific issues.
This labor-intensive process often results in delays and missed opportunities for engagement

Developing a solution that automates the identification of housing project-related hearings, extracts pertinent information, and sends timely notifications to supporters will streamline advocacy efforts and encourage community involvement.

## Focus Areas:

Data Scraping: Create mechanisms to extract information from public agendas, livestreamed hearings, and relevant sources like SF Gov TV.
Issue Tracking: Develop algorithms to identify and extract discussions related to housing projects and specific issues within the hearings.
Automated Notifications: Design a system to send real-time notifications to supporters when relevant hearings and discussions occur.

## Key Stakeholders:

- Housing Advocacy Groups (YIMBY, Housing Coalition Action)
- Community Supporters
- Local Government Agencies

## Expected Outcomes:

Timely Engagement: Enable housing advocacy groups to promptly engage supporters in relevant public hearings.
Increased Participation: Encourage community involvement by providing automated updates on critical housing-related discussions.
Streamlined Processes: Reduce manual effort and human error associated with tracking and notifying supporters about hearings.
